Overview:
This is the final project for the HTML section of the foundations course through The Odin Project. This website will have an index page and a few recipe links. Though the relaxed outline for this project jokes about brutalist web design, I am especially keen to it. I don't know what that says about me, nor do I want to find out. 

Reflection:
